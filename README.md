# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Optimized K-Nearest Neighbors
###  Project Description

This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset and an optimized K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

The goal of the project is to:

Achieve high classification accuracy (~95%) on MNIST.

Reduce prediction latency by 25% through vectorized NumPy operations.

Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and K-fold cross-validation.

Build a scalable machine learning pipeline that processes large image datasets 30% faster.

The project demonstrates how classical machine learning models can be optimized for real-time applications like banking check digit recognition, postal code reading, and OCR-based document digitization.
